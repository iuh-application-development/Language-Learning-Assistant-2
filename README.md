# I miss you

Lazy moon<br>
Cat is yawning<br>
I think of you, suddenly, unpreparedly<br>
You and I, like a fairy tale at that time<br>
But with a different ending<br><br>

I told myself a million times<br>
If I got another chance<br>
I told myself a million times<br>
I will definitely<br><br>

But today, I understand<br>
Even if there is another chance<br>
Reality won't be better than the story..
