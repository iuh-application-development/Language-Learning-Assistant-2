# I miss you

Lazy moon \\
Cat is yawning
I think of you, suddenly, unpreparedly
You and I, like a fairy tale at that time
But with a different ending
I told myself a million times
If I got another chance
I told myself a million times
I will definitely
But today, I understand
Even if there is another chance
Reality won't be better than the story.
